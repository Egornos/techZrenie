    "## Common Locus of Points\n",
    "\n",
    "The main principle of the Hough transform [1] is to find a common *locus of points*. For example, this approach is used when designing a triangle along three given sides. At first one side of the triangle is laid off, after that the ends of the segment are considered as the centers of circles with radii equal to the lengths of the second and third segments. The intersection of the two circles is the common locus of points, from where the segments are drawn to the ends of the first segment. In other words, a *voting* of two points was held in favor of the probable location of the third vertex of the triangle. As a result of *voting* the *winner* was the point that got two *votes* (the points on the circles got one vote each, and outside them, they got zero), see Fig. 1.\n",

The set of possible circle centers for the desired radius around each characteristic point forms a circle of radius $R$, see Fig. 2 below.

Then we can define the Hough parameter space with coordinated $\\rho$ and $\\Theta$.

Thus, any two sinusoidal response functions in the parameter space will intersect at the point $(\\rho,\\Theta)$ only if the points originating them in the source Cartesian space lie on a single straight line, see Fig. 4.

The Hough transform for circles is parameterized in the following way:\n",
    "    - `method` parameter defines one of two possible methods for this transformation, it can be either `cv2.HOUGH_GRADIENT` or `cv2.HOUGH_GRADIENT_ALT`. These methods are almost similar, however the second one should give a bit better accuracy.\n",
    "    - `dp` parameter defines the scale ratio of the accumulator matrix. The resolution of the accumulator matrix is `dp` times smaller than the resolution of the source image. In most cases, $1.5$ would fit well.\n",

    "    - `param2` parameter defines the threshold for the circle detection. In the case of the `cv2.HOUGH_GRADIENT` method, it is the accumulator matrix value, while for the `cv2.HOUGH_GRADIENT_ALT` method it is the circle quality measure defined in $[0, 1]$ range where $1$ is a perfect circle.\n",

Optional parameters allow specifying the minimum distances between picked circle centers (`min_xdistance` along $Ox$ and `min_ydistance` along $Oy$), the `threshold` parameter for peaks (half of the maximum `hspaces` value by default), the maximum number of peaks selected in a single layer Hough parameter space and all spaces total (`num_peaks` and `total_num_peaks` parameters correspondingly).
