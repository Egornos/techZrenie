    "Let us try doing segmentation using *Entropy* of a pixel neighborhood as a texture characteristic. For this we have to calculate the image Entropy first, then threshold it to get the starting morphology. Unfortunately, OpenCV does not provide the corresponding function for Entropy calculation, however, in the case of Python it can be found in the scikit-image library named `skimage.filters.rank.entropy()`. To define the neighboring area we will use the rectangular $9\\times9$ kernel created by `skimage.morphology.square()` function. Since scikit-image converts an image to `float64` type we have to do a backward conversion along with normalization to a $[0, 1]$ range."
